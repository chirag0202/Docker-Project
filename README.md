DOCKER PROJECT
<p>
I did the docker course of IIEC_RISE under the guidance of Mr. Vimal Daga Sir.

It uses the concept of Infrastructure As Code(IAC) implemented using docker-compose on top of RHEL 8. 

I used the following docker images for the setup:
1) nextcloud as the frontend 
2) MariaDB as backend for data storage
The infrastructure can be lauched using the command 'docker-compose up'.

Nextcloud is a suite of client-server software for creating and using file hosting services. Nextcloud is free and open-source, which means that anyone is allowed to install and operate it on their own private server devices.

Nextcloud application functionally is similar to Dropbox, Office 365 or Google Drive, but can be used on home-local computers or for off-premises file storage hosting.
Nextcloud Version Used: Latest
